The class 'Garage' has the following methods:
    - getTicket: issues the tickets for drivers 
    - payPark: the drivers can pay for the garage with their ticket numbers
    - leaveGar: check if the ticket is paid and let the drivers exit the garage 

The function 'run' instantiates the class 'Garage' and asks the user for available actions.
There is a hidden input, 'quit', to quit the program.



Contributions to the code: 
    - Vida: I worked on class methods with Luis together and wrote the "run" function. 
    - Luis: I worked on class methods, and the pop idea for the 'getTicket" method, and added the 'chicago' list inside the class.
